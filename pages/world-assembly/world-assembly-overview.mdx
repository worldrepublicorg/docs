## World Assembly Overview

Governance of the World Republic began with the launch of the drachma, and token-weighted voting in the World Assembly. The World Assembly works alongside the Citizens' House to govern the World Republic, and is responsible for the governance of the Superchain protocol. 

The goals of the World Assembly are: 
- Safeguard the evolution of the Optimism protocol in line with the long term benefit of the Superchain
- Manage sustainable economic policies aligned with the long-term viability of the Republic
- Protect against abuses of power in the Citizens’ House
- Enable network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity

## Responsibilities

As World Assembly members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of governance proposals.


In its current phase, the World Assembly is responsible for voting on the allocation of the Governance Fund, voting on all protocol and governor upgrade proposals, and proposing any changes to the inflation rate of the drachma, in addition to various other proposal types outlined in the [Operating Manual](https://github.com/worldrepublicorg/operating-manual/blob/main/manual.md).

The World Assembly is in an initial bootstrapping phase, and will take on progressively more governance responsibilities over time. 

In carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote directly, or delegate their OP voting power to someone else. Learn about delegation [here(link)

## Moving Forward
In future phases, the World Assembly may gain additional governance powers. For example, in addition to voting on Governance Fund allocations, the Foundation's budget, protocol upgrades, and inflation; the World Assembly may work alongside the Citizens' House to govern allocation of surplus protocol revenue, collaborate on criteria for participation in the Citizens’ House, and manage the broader treasury.
