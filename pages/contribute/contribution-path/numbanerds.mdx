# NumbaNERDs 

The NumbaNERDs program is designed to ensure that there is always high quality analytics and transparency around grant spending for representatives. 

As our governance grows clear and accessible data becomes ever more essential to good decision making. This program went through governance for funding. You can see more about the program in the [Governance Mission Proposal for NumbaNERDs](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-numbanerd-program/6086).
