## About Demo Day

Demo day was started by the World Republic Ambassador Program as a way for users to see all the cool dApps of the World Republic! It runs every Thursday at 4pm UTC.  dApps have ~15 minutes to showcase, we recommend 10 minutes to present and another 5 for questions. This can be anything from a full run through, to showing off a new feature, or promoting a special event on the dApp!


To apply to be featured in our next Demo Day, head over to the [Demo-day channel](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/960493820674465883) in our Discord (it's under events).
