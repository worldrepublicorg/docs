## Individual identity

The World Republic represents individuals using unique identifiers generated through the [Farcaster protocol id registry](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-registry). This system ensures a secure approach to identity management within the Republic.

### Registering a user ID

To obtain a unique identifier:

1.  Use the **[Farcaster Id Gateway](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-gateway)**
2.  Use the Warpcast app, which:

*   Creates a new custody address
*   Acts as a wallet

### Making attestations

When you make attestations about individuals:

*   Leave the recipient address blank
*   Enter the users id into the attestation metadata
