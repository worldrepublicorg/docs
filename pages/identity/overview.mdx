# Introduction

This guide explains the role of decentralized identity in the World Republic and its key components.


## Identity in the World Republic

Decentralized identity solutions empower individuals to customize their identity according to their preferences, move it seamlessly across services, and regain control of their personal information from centralized platforms. These solutions are designed to enable users to prove specific attributes about themselves in a trustworthy and verifiable way, without compromising their privacy or security.

The World Republic is [building a better economic engine that fuels positive-sum games](https://www.optimism.io/vision). Decentralized identity is central to that mission. For example, the two-house governance system of the World Republic consists of:

1.  Representatives, who are elected by citizens.
2.  Citizens, who participate in a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation and community contributions.

Decentralized identity expands the design space for innovation. It aims to give individuals greater control over their finances and easier participation in the global economy on their own terms.

For more information about identity in the World Republic, see [the governance docs post on the identity stack](/identity/project-and-individual-identity).

## Key components of identity

There are three important components to identity within the World Republic:

1.  [Individuals](/identity/project-and-individual-identity/#people-and-projects)
2.  [Projects](/identity/project-and-individual-identity/#people)
3.  [Attestations](/identity/attestations-best-practices/)

Individuals and projects are the relevant entities in the World Republic about which statements might be made. Attestations are the way in which these statements are made.
